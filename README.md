## Introduction

I, like most parents, enjoy playing board games with my kids and one they particularly enjoy is Dragonwood. I have played quite a few games with my kids and started to wonder what the best strategy was and how I can increase my probability of winning. It seems that my kids seem to have an innate understanding of the probabilities involved and have started to beat me more and more.

My approach to understanding this problem is to create a way of playing thousands of games of Dragonwood which should enable me to test out strategies and see which are most successful. Once a suitable system has been developed a stretch goal would be to train an AI to play against a deterministic opponent and see if an AI can find a better approach than I can.

## The Game

Dragonwood is a fantasy-themed card and dice game designed by Darren Kisgen. Set in the mystical realm of Dragonwood, players embark on an adventurous quest to capture magical creatures and collect valuable items. The game revolves around the strategic use of cards representing adventurers, creatures, and enhancements, as well as dice for resolving conflicts. Players face the dual challenge of building a powerful deck and employing effective dice rolls to defeat various creatures in the dangerous forest. The game combines luck and strategy, offering a dynamic and engaging experience as players strive to accumulate the most victory points by the end of the game. Dragonwood's accessible mechanics make it suitable for players of various ages, providing an enjoyable and immersive gaming experience in a whimsical fantasy setting.

## Python Model

The first step of the process is to create a model within python to allow me to play dragonwood, based on the [ruleset](https://aadl.org/files/catalog_guides/Dragonwood%20-%20rules.pdf) published online.
